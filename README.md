# Welcome to my Docker Chrome container.

This is a XRDP container containing Fluxbox and firefox.
Edit the environment file to suits your needs. The XRDP login corresponds with the Linux user and Password.
Once started, there will be no menuitem for Firefox. Thus will be implemented in a future update, but i'm lazy. :)

The home dir is in a sepperate volume for future update or rebuilding the container.

Have fun!
